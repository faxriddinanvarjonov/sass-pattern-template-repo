          >The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly known as the
          United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country primarily located
          in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five
          major unincorporated territories, nine Minor Outlying Islands,[i] and
          326 Indian reservations. The United States is the world's
          third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land
          borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has
          maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j]
          With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous
          country in the Americas and the third most populous in the world. The
          national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its
          most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.
          Indigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years.
          Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of
          the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They
          quarreled with the British Crown over taxation and political
          representation, leading to the American Revolution and proceeding
          Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4,
          1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment
          principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and
          liberal democracy. During the nineteenth century, the United States
          political philosophy was influenced by the concept of manifest
          destiny, as the country expanded across the continent in a number of
          wars, land purchases, and treaties, eventually reaching the Pacific
          Ocean by the middle of the century. Sectional division surrounding
          slavery in the Southern United States led to the secession of the
          Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of
          the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's
          victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally by the
          Thirteenth Amendment. By 1900, the United States had established
          itself as a world power, becoming the world's largest economy. After
          Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II
          on the Allied side. The aftermath of the war left the United States
          and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the
          Cold War. During the Cold War, both countries engaged in a struggle
          for ideological dominance but avoided direct military conflict. They
          also competed in the Space Race, which culminated in the 1969 landing
          of Apollo 11, making the U.S. the first and only nation to ever land
          humans on the Moon. With the Soviet Union's collapse and the
          subsequent end of the Cold War in 1991, the United States emerged as
          the world's sole superpower. The United States government is a federal
          republic and a representative democracy with three separate branches
          of government. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the
          House of Representatives, a lower house; and the Senate, an upper
          house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues
          are decentralized, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction. The
          U.S. ranks highly in international measures of quality of life, income
          and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and
          education; it has low levels of perceived corruption and the highest
          median income per person of any polity in the world. It has high
          levels of incarceration and inequality and lacks universal health
          care. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been
          shaped by the world's largest immigrant population. A developed
          country, the American economy accounts for approximately a quarter of
          global GDP and is the world's largest by GDP at market exchange rates.
          The United States is the world's largest importer and second-largest
          exporter. The United States is a founding member of the United
          Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of
          American States, NATO, World Health Organization, and is a permanent
          member of the United Nations Security Council. The U.S. is the
          foremost military power in the world and a dominant political,
          cultural, and scientific force internationally. Etymology Further
          information: Names of the United States and Names for United States
          citizens The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States
          of America" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by
          Stephen Moylan to Joseph Reed, George Washington's aide-de-camp.
          Moylan expressed his wish to go "with full and ample powers from the
          United States of America to Spain" to seek assistance in the
          revolutionary war effort.[27][28][29] The first known publication of
          the phrase "United States of America" was in an anonymous essay in The
          Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.[30] By
          June 1776, the name "United States of America" had appeared in drafts
          of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, prepared by John
          Dickinson[31][32] and of the Declaration of Independence, written by
          Thomas Jefferson.[31] The phrase "United States" was originally plural
          in American usage. It described a collection of states—e.g., "the
          United States are..." The singular form became popular after the end
          of the Civil War and is now standard usage. A citizen of the United
          States is called an "American". "United States", "American", and
          "U.S." refer to the country adjectivally ("American values", "U.S.
          forces"). In English, the word "American" rarely refers to topics or
          subjects not directly connected with the United States.</i
