        >Minnesota (/ˌmɪnɪˈsoʊtə/ (listen)) is a state in the Upper Midwestern
        region of the United States. It is the 12th largest U.S. state in area
        and the 22nd most populous, with over 5.75 million residents. Minnesota
        is home to western prairies, now given over to intensive agriculture;
        deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed, and
        settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry,
        and recreation. Roughly a third of the state is covered in forests, and
        it is known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes" for having over 14,000 bodies
        of fresh water covering at least ten acres.[7] More than 60% of
        Minnesotans live in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, known
        as the "Twin Cities", the state's main political, economic, and cultural
        hub.[8] With a population of about 3.7 million, the Twin Cities is the
        16th largest metropolitan area in the U.S. Other minor metropolitan and
        micropolitan statistical areas in the state include Duluth, Mankato,
        Moorhead, Rochester, and St. Cloud.[9] Minnesota, which gets its name
        from the Dakota language, has been inhabited by various indigenous
        peoples since the Woodland period of the 11th century BCE. Between
        roughly 200 and 500 CE, two areas of the indigenous Hopewell tradition
        emerged: the Laurel complex in the north, and Trempealeau Hopewell in
        the Mississippi River Valley in the south. The Upper Mississippian
        culture, consisting of the Oneota people and other Siouan speakers,
        emerged around 1000 CE and lasted through the arrival of Europeans in
        the 17th century. French explorers and missionaries were the earliest
        Europeans to enter the region, encountering the Dakota, Ojibwe, and
        various Anishinaabe tribes. Much of what is now Minnesota formed part of
        the vast French holding of Louisiana, which the United States purchased
        in 1803. After several territorial reorganizations, the Minnesota
        Territory was admitted to the Union as the 32nd state in 1858.
        Minnesota's official motto, L'Étoile du Nord, is the only state motto in
        French; meaning "The Star of the North", it was adopted shortly after
        statehood and reflects both the state's early French explorers and its
        position as the northernmost state in the contiguous U.S.</i
