        >Missouri is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States.[6]
        Ranking 21st in land area, it is bordered by eight states (tied for the
        most with Tennessee): Iowa to the north, Illinois, Kentucky and
        Tennessee to the east, Arkansas to the south and Oklahoma, Kansas, and
        Nebraska to the west. In the south are the Ozarks, a forested highland,
        providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Missouri River, after
        which the state is named, flows through the center into the Mississippi
        River, which makes up the eastern border. With more than six million
        residents, it is the 19th-most populous state of the country. The
        largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and
        Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City. Humans have inhabited what is
        now Missouri for at least 12,000 years. The Mississippian culture, which
        emerged at least in the ninth century, built cities and mounds before
        declining in the 14th century. When European explorers arrived in the
        17th century, they encountered the Osage and Missouria nations. The
        French incorporated the territory into Louisiana, founding Ste.
        Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish
        rule, the United States acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana
        Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South rushed into the new
        Missouri Territory. Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of
        the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Many from Virginia, Kentucky, and
        Tennessee settled in the Boonslick area of Mid-Missouri. Soon after,
        heavy German immigration formed the Missouri Rhineland. Missouri played
        a central role in the westward expansion of the United States, as
        memorialized by the Gateway Arch. The Pony Express, Oregon Trail, Santa
        Fe Trail and California Trail all began in Missouri.[7] As a border
        state, Missouri's role in the American Civil War was complex, and it was
        subject to rival governments, raids, and guerilla warfare. After the
        war, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became
        centers of industrialization and business. Today the state is divided
        into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Missouri's
        culture blends elements of the Midwestern and Southern United States. It
        is the birthplace of the musical genres ragtime, Kansas City jazz and
        St. Louis blues. The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue, and the
        lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue, can be found across the state and
        beyond. Missouri is a major center of beer brewing and has some of the
        most permissive alcohol laws in the U.S.[8] It is home to
        Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest beer producer, and produces an
        eponymous wine produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. Outside
        the state's major cities, popular tourist destinations include the Lake
        of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and Branson. Well-known Missourians
        include Chuck Berry, Sheryl Crow, Walt Disney, Edwin Hubble, Nelly, Brad
        Pitt, Harry S. Truman, and Mark Twain. Some of the largest companies
        based in the state include Cerner, Express Scripts, Monsanto, Emerson
        Electric, Edward Jones, H&R Block, Wells Fargo Advisors, Centene
        Corporation, and O'Reilly Auto Parts. Well-known universities in
        Missouri include the University of Missouri, Saint Louis University, and
        Washington University in St. Louis.[9] Missouri has been called the
        "Mother of the West", the "Cave State", and the "Show Me State".[10]
