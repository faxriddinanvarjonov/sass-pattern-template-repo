    <p>
      New Mexico (Spanish: Nuevo México[Note 2][6] [ˈnweβo ˈmexiko] (listen);
      Navajo: Yootó Hahoodzo Navajo pronunciation: [jòːtʰó hɑ̀hòːtsò]) is a state
      in the Southwestern United States. It is one of the Mountain States of the
      southern Rocky Mountains, sharing the Four Corners region of the western
      U.S. with Utah, Colorado, and Arizona, and bordering Texas to the east and
      southeast, Oklahoma to the northeast, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua
      and Sonora to the south. New Mexico's largest city is Albuquerque, and its
      state capital is Santa Fe, the oldest state capital in the U.S., founded
      in 1610 as the government seat of Nuevo México in New Spain. New Mexico is
      the fifth largest of the fifty states, but with just over 2.1 million
      residents, ranks 36th in population and 46th in population density.[7] Its
      climate and geography are highly varied, ranging from forested mountains
      to sparse deserts; the northern and eastern regions exhibit a colder
      alpine climate, while the west and south are warmer and more arid. The Rio
      Grande and its fertile valley runs from north-to-south, creating a
      riparian climate through the center of the state that supports a bosque
      habitat and distinct Albuquerque Basin climate. One–third of New Mexico's
      land is federally owned, and the state hosts many protected wilderness
      areas and national monuments, including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites,
      the most of any state.[8] New Mexico's economy is highly diversified,
      including cattle ranching, agriculture, lumber, scientific and
      technological research, tourism, and the arts, especially textiles and
      visual arts. Major sectors include mining, oil and gas, aerospace, media,
      and film.[9][10][11][12] Its total gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020
      was $95.73 billion, with a GDP per capita of roughly $46,300.[13][14]
      State tax policy is characterized by low to moderate taxation of resident
      personal income by national standards, with tax credits, exemptions, and
      special considerations for military personnel and favorable industries.
      Due to its large area and economic climate,[15] New Mexico has a
      significant U.S. military presence, including White Sands Missile Range,
      and strategically valuable federal research centers, such as Sandia and
      Los Alamos National Laboratories. The state hosted several key facilities
      of the Manhattan Project, which developed the world's first atomic bomb,
      and was the site of the first nuclear test, Trinity.
