      Ohio, officially the State of Ohio (/oʊˈhaɪoʊ/ (listen)) is a state in the
      Midwestern United States. Of the fifty U.S. states, it is the 34th-largest
      by area. With a population of nearly 11.8 million, Ohio is the
      seventh-most populous and tenth-most densely populated state. Its capital
      and largest city is Columbus, with the Columbus metro area, Greater
      Cincinnati, and Greater Cleveland being the largest metropolitan areas.
      Ohio is bordered by Lake Erie to the north, Pennsylvania to the east, West
      Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Indiana to the west,
      and Michigan to the northwest. Ohio is nicknamed the "Buckeye State" after
      its Ohio buckeye trees, and Ohioans are also known as "Buckeyes".[10] Its
      state flag is the only non-rectangular flag of all the U.S. states. Ohio
      takes its name from the Ohio River, which, in turn, originated from the
      Seneca word ohiːyo', meaning "good river", "great river", or "large
      creek".[13][14] The state arose from the lands west of the Appalachian
      Mountains that were contested from colonial times through the Northwest
      Indian Wars of the late 18th century. It was partitioned from the
      resulting Northwest Territory, which was the first frontier of the new
      United States, becoming the 17th state admitted to the Union on March 1,
      1803, and the first under the Northwest Ordinance.[3][15] Ohio was the
      first post-colonial free state admitted to the union and became one of the
      earliest and most influential industrial powerhouses during the 20th
      century. Although it has transitioned to a more information- and
      service-based economy in the 21st century, it remains an industrial state,
      ranking seventh in GDP as of 2019,[16] with the third-largest
      manufacturing sector and second-largest automobile production.[17] The
      government of Ohio is composed of the executive branch, led by the
      governor; the legislative branch, consisting of the bicameral Ohio General
      Assembly; and the judicial branch, led by the state Supreme Court. Ohio
      occupies 16 seats in the United States House of Representatives.[18] The
      state is known for its status as both a swing state and a bellwether in
      national elections.[19] Seven presidents of the United States have come
      from Ohio. This has led to it receiving the moniker "the Mother of
      Presidents".[20]
