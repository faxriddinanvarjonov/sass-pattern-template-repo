      >Connecticut (/kəˈnɛtɪkət/ (listen) kə-NET-ik-ət)[10] is the southernmost
      state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. As of
      the 2020 United States census, Connecticut was home to over 3.6 million
      residents, its highest decennial count ever, growing every decade since
      1790. The state is bordered by Rhode Island to its east, Massachusetts to
      its north, New York to its west, and Long Island Sound to its south. Its
      capital is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport.
      Historically, the state is part of New England as well as the tri-state
      area with New York and New Jersey. The state is named for the Connecticut
      River which approximately bisects the state. The word Connecticut is
      derived from various anglicized spellings of Quinnetuket, a Mohegan-Pequot
      word for "long tidal river".[11]
