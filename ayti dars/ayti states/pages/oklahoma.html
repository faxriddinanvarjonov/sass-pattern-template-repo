    <h2>About oklahoma</h2>
    <p>
      Oklahoma (/ˌoʊkləˈhoʊmə/ (listen);[6] Choctaw: Oklahumma, pronounced
      [oklahómma];[7] Cherokee: ᎣᎧᎳᎰᎹ, Okalahoma pronounced [ògàlàhǒːmã́])[8] is
      a state in the South Central region of the United States,[9] bordered by
      Texas on the south and west, Kansas on the north, Missouri on the
      northeast, Arkansas on the east, New Mexico on the west, and Colorado on
      the northwest. Partially in the western extreme of the Upland South, it is
      the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United
      States. Its residents are known as Oklahomans and its capital and largest
      city is Oklahoma City. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words
      okla, 'people' and humma, which translates as 'red'.[10] Oklahoma is also
      known informally by its nickname, "The Sooner State", in reference to the
      settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date
      of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the Indian
      Appropriations Act of 1889, which increased European-American settlement
      in the eastern Indian Territory. Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory
      were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to
      enter the union on November 16, 1907. With ancient mountain ranges,
      prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great
      Plains, Cross Timbers, and the U.S. Interior Highlands, all regions prone
      to severe weather.[11] Oklahoma is at a confluence of three major American
      cultural regions. Historically, it served as a government-sanctioned
      territory for Native Americans removed from east of the Mississippi River,
      a route for cattle drives from Texas and related regions, and a
      destination for Southern settlers. There are currently twenty-five Native
      American languages spoken in Oklahoma.[12] A major producer of natural
      gas, oil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base
      of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology.[13] Oklahoma
      City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly
      two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical
      areas.[14]
