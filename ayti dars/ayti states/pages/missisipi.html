        >Mississippi (/ˌmɪsɪˈsɪpi/ (listen)) is a state in the Southeastern
        region of the United States, bordered to the north by Tennessee; to the
        east by Alabama; to the south by the Gulf of Mexico; to the southwest by
        Louisiana; and to the northwest by Arkansas. Mississippi's western
        boundary is largely defined by the Mississippi River. Mississippi is the
        32nd largest by area and 35th-most populous of the 50 U.S. states and
        has the lowest per-capita income in the United States. Jackson is both
        the state's capital and largest city. Greater Jackson is the state's
        most populous metropolitan area, with a population of 591,978 in
        2020.[6] On December 10, 1817, Mississippi became the 20th state
        admitted to the Union. By 1860, Mississippi was the nation's top
        cotton-producing state and slaves accounted for 55% of the state
        population.[7] Mississippi declared its secession from the Union on
        January 9, 1861, and was one of the seven original Confederate States,
        which constituted the largest slaveholding states in the nation.
        Following the Civil War, it was restored to the Union on February 23,
        1870.[8] Mississippi was the site of many prominent events during the
        civil rights movement, including the Ole Miss riot of 1962, the 1963
        assassination of Medgar Evers, and the 1964 Freedom Summer murders.
        Mississippi ranks among the lowest of U.S. states in measures of health,
        education, development, and income.[9][10][11][12] Top economic
        industries in Mississippi today are agriculture and forestry.
        Mississippi produces more than half of the country's farm-raised
        catfish, and is also a top producer of sweet potatoes, cotton and
        pulpwood. Other main industries in Mississippi include advanced
        manufacturing, utilities, transportation, and health services.[13]
        Mississippi is almost entirely within the Gulf coastal plain, and
        generally consists of lowland plains and low hills. The northwest
        remainder of the state consists of the Mississippi Delta, a section of
        the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Mississippi's highest point is Woodall
        Mountain at 807 feet (246 m) above sea level adjacent to the Cumberland
        Plateau; the lowest is the Gulf of Mexico. Mississippi has a humid
        subtropical climate classification.</i
