        >Indiana, constituent state of the United States of America. The state
        sits, as its motto claims, at “the crossroads of America.” It borders
        Lake Michigan and the state of Michigan to the north, Ohio to the east,
        Kentucky to the south, and Illinois to the west, making it an integral
        part of the American Midwest. It ranks 38th among the 50 U.S. states in
        terms of total area and, except for Hawaii, is the smallest state west
        of the Appalachian Mountains. With a name that is generally thought to
        mean “land of the Indians,” Indiana was admitted on December 11, 1816,
        as the 19th state of the union. Its capital has been at Indianapolis
        since 1825. Today Indiana’s economy is based primarily on services,
        manufacturing, and, to a much lesser extent, agriculture. Its northern
        areas lie in the mainstream of the industrial belt that extends from
        Pennsylvania and New York to Illinois. Agricultural activity is heaviest
        in the central region, which is situated in the Corn Belt, which
        stretches from Ohio to Nebraska. Although Indiana is historically part
        of the North, many parts of the state display a character that is much
        like that of the South. This is largely a reflection of the early
        settlement of the region by migrants from the South, who brought with
        them a hearty distrust of the federal government. Many of Indiana’s
        people take pride in a self-image derived largely from 19th-century
        America that values hard work, is oriented to the small town and
        medium-sized city, and is interested in maintaining the prerogatives of
        local self-determination. It is not by coincidence that the Indianan’s
        nickname, Hoosier, remains a symbol in the country’s lore for a kind of
        homespun wisdom, wit, and folksiness that harks back to what is
        popularly regarded as a less-hurried and less-complicated period of
        history.</i
