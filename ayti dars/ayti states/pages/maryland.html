        >Maryland (US: /ˈmɛrɪlənd/ (listen) MERR-il-ənd)[b] is a state in the
        Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.[8][9] It borders Virginia,
        West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania
        to its north; and Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. With a
        total land area of 12,407 square miles (32,130 km2), Maryland is the
        8th-smallest state by land area, but its population of 6,177,224 ranks
        it the 18th-most populous state and the 5th-most densely populated.
        Baltimore[10] is the largest city in the state, and the capital is
        Annapolis. The western portion of the state contains numerous stretches
        of the Appalachian Mountains, while the central portion is primarily
        composed of the Piedmont. The eastern side of the state makes up the
        Chesapeake Bay, sharing the border with Delaware, and the southeastern
        side borders the Atlantic Ocean. Among its occasional nicknames are Old
        Line State, the Free State, and the Chesapeake Bay State. It is named
        after Henrietta Maria, the French-born queen of England, Scotland, and
        Ireland, who was known then in England as Mary.[11][12] Before its
        coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Maryland was
        inhabited by several groups of Native Americans – mostly by Algonquian
        peoples and, to a lesser degree, Iroquoian and Siouan.[13] As one of the
        original Thirteen Colonies of England, Maryland was founded by George
        Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, a Catholic convert[14][15] who sought to
        provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England.[16] In
        1632, Charles I of England granted Lord Baltimore a colonial charter,
        naming the colony after his wife, Henrietta Maria.[17] Unlike the
        Pilgrims and Puritans, who rejected Catholicism in their settlements,
        Lord Baltimore envisioned a colony where people of different religious
        sects would coexist under the principle of toleration.[16] Accordingly,
        in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion,
        which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who "reproached" a
        fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation.[18] Nevertheless,
        religious strife was common in the early years, and Catholics remained a
        minority, albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony.
        Maryland's early settlements and population centers clustered around
        rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay. Its
        economy was heavily plantation-based and centered mostly on the
        cultivation of tobacco. Demand for cheap labor from Maryland colonists
        led to the importation of numerous indentured servants and enslaved
        Africans. In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the
        settlement of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland
        was an active participant in the events leading up to the American
        Revolution, and by 1776, its delegates signed the Declaration of
        Independence. Many of its citizens subsequently played key political and
        military roles in the war. In 1790, the state ceded land for the
        establishment of the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C.</i
