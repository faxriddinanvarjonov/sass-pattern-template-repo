      Pennsylvania (/ˌpɛnsɪlˈveɪniə/ (listen); Pennsylvania German:
      Pennsilfaani), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,[b] is a state
      spanning the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, Appalachian, and Great Lakes
      regions of the United States. Pennsylvania borders Delaware to its
      southeast, Maryland to its south, West Virginia to its southwest, Ohio to
      its west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to its northwest,
      New York state to its north, and the Delaware River and New Jersey to its
      east. Pennsylvania is the fifth-most populous state in the nation with
      over 13 million residents as of 2020, its highest decennial count ever.[4]
      The state is the 33rd-largest by area and ranks ninth among all states in
      population density. The southeastern Delaware Valley metropolitan area
      comprises and surrounds Philadelphia, the state's largest and nation's
      sixth-most populous city. Another 2.37 million reside in Greater
      Pittsburgh in the southwest, centered in and around Pittsburgh, the
      state's second-largest and Western Pennsylvania's largest city. The
      state's subsequent five most populous cities are: Allentown, Reading,
      Erie, Scranton, and Bethlehem.[7] The state capital is Harrisburg.
      Pennsylvania's geography is highly diverse: the Appalachian Mountains run
      through the center of the state; the Allegheny and Pocono mountains span
      much of Northeastern Pennsylvania; close to 60% of the state is forested.
      While it has only 140 miles (225 km) of waterfront along Lake Erie and the
      Delaware River,[8] Pennsylvania has more navigable rivers than any other
      state in the nation, including the Delaware, Ohio, and Pine Creek rivers.
