        >California is a state in the Western United States, located along the
        Pacific Coast. With nearly 39.2 million residents[6] across a total area
        of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2),[11] it is the most
        populous U.S. state and the third-largest by area. It is also the most
        populated subnational entity in North America and the 34th most populous
        in the world. The Greater Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas are
        the nation's second and fifth most populous urban regions respectively,
        with the former having more than 18.7 million residents and the latter
        having over 9.6 million.[12] Sacramento is the state's capital, while
        Los Angeles is the most populous city in the state and the second most
        populous city in the country. San Francisco is the second most densely
        populated major city in the country. Los Angeles County is the country's
        most populous, while San Bernardino County is the largest county by area
        in the country. California borders Oregon to the north, Nevada and
        Arizona to the east, the Mexican state of Baja California to the south;
        and it has a coastline along the Pacific Ocean to the west. California's
        economy is the largest of any state within the United States, with a
        $3.37 trillion gross state product (GSP) as of 2022.[13] It is the
        largest sub-national economy in the world. If California were a
        sovereign nation, it would rank as the world's fifth-largest economy as
        of 2022,[14][15] behind India and ahead of the United Kingdom, as well
        as the 37th most populous.[16] The Greater Los Angeles area and the San
        Francisco area are the nation's second- and fourth-largest urban
        economies ($1.0 trillion and $0.6 trillion respectively as of 2020),
        following the New York metropolitan area's $1.8 trillion.[17] The San
        Francisco Bay Area Combined Statistical Area had the nation's highest
        gross domestic product per capita ($106,757) among large primary
        statistical areas in 2018,[18] and is home to five of the world's ten
        largest companies by market capitalization[19] and four of the world's
        ten richest people.[20] Slightly over 84 percent of the state's
        residents hold a high school degree, the lowest high school education
        rate of all 50 states.</i
