    <h2>About Alabama:</h2>
    <p>
      <i
        >Alabama, constituent state of the United States of America, admitted to
        the union in 1819 as the 22nd state. Alabama forms a roughly rectangular
        shape on the map, elongated in a north-south direction. It is bordered
        by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, and Mississippi to the
        west. The Florida panhandle blocks Alabama’s access to the Gulf of
        Mexico except in Alabama’s southwestern corner, where Mobile Bay is
        located. Montgomery is the state capital. The state offers much
        topographical diversity. The rich agricultural valley of the Tennessee
        River occupies the extreme northern part of the state. In northeastern
        Alabama the broken terrain of the southwestern fringe of the Appalachian
        Mountains begins and continues in a southwesterly progression across the
        northern half of the state. Below that the band of prairie lowland known
        as the Black Belt has rich soils that once cradled a rural
        cotton-producing way of life central to the state’s development. Farther
        south stretch piney woods and then coastal plains until one reaches the
        moss-draped live oaks of Mobile and the white beaches of the gulf.</i
