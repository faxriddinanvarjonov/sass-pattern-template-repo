      Colorado (/ˌkɒləˈrædoʊ, -ˈrɑːdoʊ/ (listen),[7][8] other variants[9]) is a
      state in the Mountain West sub-region of the Western United States. It
      encompasses most of the Southern Rocky Mountains, as well as the
      northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the
      Great Plains. Colorado is the eighth most extensive and 21st most populous
      U.S. state. The United States Census Bureau estimated the population of
      Colorado at 5,839,926 as of July 1, 2022, a 1.15% increase since the 2020
      United States census.[10] The region has been inhabited by Native
      Americans and their ancestors for at least 13,500 years and possibly much
      longer. The eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains was a major migration
      route for early peoples who spread throughout the Americas. In 1848, much
      of the region was annexed to the United States with the Treaty of
      Guadalupe Hidalgo. The Pike's Peak Gold Rush of 1858-1862 created an
      influx of settlers. On February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan
      signed an act creating the Territory of Colorado,[2] and on August 1,
      1876, President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting
      Colorado to the Union as the 38th state.[3] The state was named for the
      Colorado River which early Spanish explorers named "el río Colorado" for
      the red silt the river carried from the mountains.[b][11][12][13] The
      Spanish adjective "colorado" means "colored red" or "ruddy". Colorado is
      nicknamed the "Centennial State" because it became a state one century
      (and four weeks) after the signing of the United States Declaration of
      Independence.
