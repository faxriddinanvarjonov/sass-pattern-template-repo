        >Alaska (/əˈlæskə/ (listen) ə-LAS-kə) is a U.S. state on the northwest
        extremity of North America. A semi-exclave of the U.S., it borders
        British Columbia and Yukon in Canada to the east, and it shares a
        western maritime border in the Bering Strait with the Russian
        Federation's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. To the north are the Chukchi and
        Beaufort Seas of the Arctic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean lies to the
        south and southwest. Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area,
        comprising more total area than the next three largest states of Texas,
        California, and Montana combined, and is the seventh-largest subnational
        division in the world. It is the third-least populous and most sparsely
        populated U.S. state, but with a population of 736,081 as of 2020, is
        the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th
        parallel, with more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern
        Canada and Greenland.[3] The state capital of Juneau is the
        second-largest city in the United States by area, and the former capital
        of Alaska, Sitka, is the largest U.S. city by area. Approximately half
        of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area.
        Indigenous people have lived in Alaska for thousands of years, and it is
        widely believed that the region served as the entry point for the
        initial settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge.
        The Russian Empire was the first to actively colonize the area beginning
        in the 18th century, eventually establishing Russian America, which
        spanned most of the current state, and promoted and maintained a native
        Alaskan Creole population.[4] The expense and logistical difficulty of
        maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in
        1867 for US$7.2 million (equivalent to $151 million in 2022). The area
        went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as
        a territory on May 11, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the
        U.S. on January 3, 1959.[5] Abundant natural resources have enabled
        Alaska—with one of the smallest state economies—to have one of the
        highest per capita incomes, with commercial fishing, and the extraction
        of natural gas and oil, dominating Alaska's economy. U.S. Armed Forces
        bases and tourism also contribute to the economy; more than half the
        state is federally-owned land containing national forests, national
        parks, and wildlife refuges.</i
