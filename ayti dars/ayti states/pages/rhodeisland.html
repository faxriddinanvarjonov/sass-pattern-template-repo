    <h2>About rhode island</h2>
    <p>
      Island (/ˌroʊd-/ (listen), like road)[6][7] is a state in the New England
      region of the Northeastern United States. It is the smallest U.S. state by
      area and the seventh-least populous, with slightly less than 1.1 million
      residents as of 2020;[8] but Rhode Island has grown at every decennial
      count since 1790 and is the second-most densely populated state, after New
      Jersey. The state takes its name from the eponymous island, though nearly
      all of its land area is on the mainland. Rhode Island borders Connecticut
      to its west; Massachusetts to its north and east; and the Atlantic Ocean
      to its south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound; and shares a
      small maritime border with New York, east of Long Island.[9] Providence is
      its capital and most populous city. Native Americans lived around
      Narragansett Bay for thousands of years before English settlers began
      arriving in the early 17th century.[10] Rhode Island was unique among the
      Thirteen British Colonies in having been founded by a refugee, Roger
      Williams, who fled religious persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony
      to establish a haven for religious liberty. He founded Providence in 1636
      on land purchased from local tribes, thereby creating the first settlement
      in North America with an explicitly secular government.[10] The Colony of
      Rhode Island and Providence Plantations subsequently became a destination
      for religious and political dissenters and social outcasts, earning it the
      moniker "Rogue's Island".[11]
