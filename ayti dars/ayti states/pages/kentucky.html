        >With recent nursing shortages, now is the time to seek a rewarding
        career change. Transform any bachelor's degree into a nursing degree -
        become a RN in just 2 years with the Accelerated Nursing MEPN program at
        WKU! Our Master Entry Professional Nursing (MEPN) program is designed
        for highly motivated individuals who have a prior bachelor's degree in a
        non-nursing field. Once admitted, students must maintain a 3.0 or
        greater cumulative GPA average throughout the MEPN program. This
        accelerated, year-round program allows qualified individuals to graduate
        with a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) following completion of 2
        years of full-time study. Participation in this Joint Undergraduate
        Master Program (JUMP) at WKU will allow you to concurrently complete a
        Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and a Master of Science in Nursing
        (MSN). Following completion of the MEPN program, you are eligible to sit
        for NCLEX-RN, the RN licensure exam. Our two-year curriculum options
        include face-to-face, video streamed, and online instruction, with face
        to face classes meeting in Bowling Green, KY and clinical placements
        occurring in KY or TN.</i
