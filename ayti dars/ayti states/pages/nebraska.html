        >Nebraska (/nəˈbræskə/ (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern region of
        the United States. It is bordered by South Dakota to the north; Iowa to
        the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River;
        Kansas to the south; Colorado to the southwest; and Wyoming to the west.
        Indigenous peoples, including Omaha, Missouria, Ponca, Pawnee, Otoe, and
        various branches of the Lakota (Sioux) tribes, lived in the region for
        thousands of years before European exploration. The state is crossed by
        many historic trails, including that of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.
        Nebraska's area is just over 77,220 square miles (200,000 km2) with a
        population of over 1.9 million. Its capital is Lincoln, and its largest
        city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. Nebraska was admitted
        into the United States in 1867, two years after the end of the American
        Civil War. The Nebraska Legislature is unlike any other American
        legislature in that it is unicameral, and its members are elected
        without any official reference to political party affiliation. Nebraska
        is composed of two major land regions: the Dissected Till Plains and the
        Great Plains. The Dissected Till Plains region consists of gently
        rolling hills and contains the state's largest cities, Omaha and
        Lincoln. The Great Plains region, occupying most of western Nebraska, is
        characterized by treeless prairie. Nebraska has two major climatic
        zones. The eastern two-thirds of the state has a humid continental
        climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa); a unique warmer subtype
        considered "warm-temperate" exists near the southern plains, which is
        analogous to that in Kansas and Oklahoma, which have a predominantly
        humid subtropical climate. The Panhandle and adjacent areas bordering
        Colorado have a primarily semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk). The state has
        wide variations between winter and summer temperatures, variations that
        decrease moving south within the state. Violent thunderstorms and
        tornadoes occur primarily during spring and summer and sometimes in
        autumn. Chinook wind tends to warm the state significantly in the winter
        and early spring.</i
