    <h2>About newhampshire</h2>
    <p>
      New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern
      United States. It is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to
      the west, Maine and the Gulf of Maine to the east, and the Canadian
      province of Quebec to the north. Of the 50 U.S. states, New Hampshire is
      the fifth smallest by area and the tenth least populous, with a population
      of 1,377,529 million residents as of the 2020 census. Concord is the state
      capital, while Manchester is the largest city. New Hampshire's motto,
      "Live Free or Die", reflects its role in the American Revolutionary War;
      its nickname, "The Granite State", refers to its extensive granite
      formations and quarries.[11] It is well known nationwide for holding the
      first primary (after the Iowa caucus) in the U.S. presidential election
      cycle, and for its resulting influence on American electoral politics.[12]
      New Hampshire was inhabited for thousands of years by Algonquian-speaking
      peoples such as the Abenaki. Europeans arrived in the early 17th century,
      with the English establishing some of the earliest non-indigenous
      settlements. The Province of New Hampshire was established in 1629, named
      after the English county of Hampshire.[13] Following mounting tensions
      between the British colonies and the crown during the 1760s, New Hampshire
      saw one of the earliest overt acts of rebellion, with the seizing of Fort
      William and Mary from the British in 1774. In January 1776, it became the
      first of the British North American colonies to establish an independent
      government and state constitution; six months later, it signed the United
      States Declaration of Independence and contributed troops, ships, and
      supplies in the war against Britain. In June 1788, it was the ninth state
      to ratify the U.S. Constitution, bringing that document into effect.
      Through the mid-19th century, New Hampshire was an active center of
      abolitionism, and fielded close to 32,000 soldiers for the Union during
      the U.S. Civil War. After the war, the state saw rapid industrialization
      and population growth, becoming a center of textile manufacturing,
      shoemaking, and papermaking; the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company in
      Manchester was at one time the largest cotton textile plant in the world.
      The Merrimack and Connecticut rivers were lined with industrial mills,
      most of which employed workers from Canada and Europe; French Canadians
      formed the most significant influx of immigrants, and today roughly a
      quarter of all New Hampshire residents claim French American ancestry,
      second only to Maine.
