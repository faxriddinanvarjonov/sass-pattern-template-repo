      New York, often called New York State,[b] is a state in the Northeastern
      United States. With 20.2 million residents, it is the fourth-most populous
      state in the United States as of the 2020 census. New York is the
      27th-largest U.S. state by area, with a total area of 54,556 square miles
      (141,300 km2).[2] The state is bordered by New Jersey and Pennsylvania to
      its south, and Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont to its east; it
      shares a maritime border with Rhode Island, and an international border
      with the Canadian provinces of Quebec to its north and Ontario to its
      northwest. New York has a varied geography. The southeastern part of the
      state, known as Downstate, includes New York City (the most populous city
      in the United States), Long Island (the most populous island in the United
      States), and the lower Hudson Valley. These areas are part of the New York
      City metropolitan area, the world's most sprawling urban landmass,[8][9]
      and account for approximately two-thirds of the state's population. The
      much larger Upstate area spreads from the Great Lakes to Lake Champlain,
      while its Southern Tier region extends to the border of Pennsylvania.
      Upstate includes two prominent mountain ranges: the Adirondack Mountains
      and the Catskill Mountains (part of the wider Appalachian Mountains). The
      east–west Mohawk River Valley is the primary river valley bisecting more
      mountainous regions, and connects to the north–south Hudson River valley
      just north of the state capital of Albany. Western New York, home to the
      cities of Buffalo and Rochester, is part of the Great Lakes region and
      borders Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. Central New York is anchored by the
      city of Syracuse; between the central and western parts of the state, New
      York is dominated by the Finger Lakes, a popular vacation and tourist
      destination. New York was one of the original Thirteen Colonies forming
      the United States. The area of present-day New York had been inhabited by
      tribes of the Algonquians and the Iroquois Confederacy Native Americans
      for several thousand years by the time the earliest Europeans arrived.[10]
      Stemming from Henry Hudson's expedition in 1609,[11] the Dutch established
      the multiethnic colony of New Netherland in 1621, which included the
      settlements of Fort Nassau (present-day Albany)[12] and New Amsterdam
      (present-day New York City). England seized the colony from the Dutch in
      1664, renaming it the Province of New York.[13] During the American
      Revolutionary War (1775–1783), a group of colonists eventually succeeded
      in establishing independence, and joined the fledgling United States. From
      the early 19th century, New York's development of its interior, beginning
      with the construction of the Erie Canal, gave it incomparable advantages
      over other regions of the east coast.[14] The state built its political,
      cultural, and economic ascendancy over the next century, earning it the
      nickname of the "Empire State". While deindustrialization eroded a
      significant portion of the state's economy in the second half of the 20th
      century, New York in the 21st century is considered as a global node of
      creativity and entrepreneurship,[15] social tolerance,[16] and
      environmental sustainability.[17][18]
