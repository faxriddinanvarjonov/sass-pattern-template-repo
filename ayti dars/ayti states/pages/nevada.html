    <h2>About nevada</h2>
    <p>
      Nevada (/nɪˈvædə/ nih-VAD-ə; Spanish: [neˈβaða]) is a state in the Western
      region of the United States.[c] It is bordered by Oregon to the northwest,
      Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast,
      and Utah to the east. Nevada is the 7th-most extensive, the 32nd-most
      populous, and the 9th-least densely populated of the U.S. states. Nearly
      three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the
      Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area,[4] including three of the state's
      four largest incorporated cities.[5] Nevada's capital is Carson City. Las
      Vegas is the largest city in the state. Nevada is officially known as the
      "Silver State" because of the importance of silver to its history and
      economy. It is also known as the "Battle Born State" because it achieved
      statehood during the Civil War (the words "Battle Born" also appear on its
      state flag); due to the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, the Union benefited
      immensely from the support of newly awarded statehood by the infusion of
      the monetary support of nearly $400 million in silver ore generated at the
      time by the Comstock Lode.[citation needed] It is also known as the
      "Sagebrush State", for the native plant of the same name; and as the
      "Sage-hen State".[6] The name means "snowy" in Spanish, referring to
      Nevada's small overlap with the Sierra Nevada mountain range; however, the
      rest of Nevada is largely desert and semi-arid, much of it within the
      Great Basin. Areas south of the Great Basin are within the Mojave Desert,
      while Lake Tahoe and the Sierra Nevada lie on the western edge. About 86%
      of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the U.S.
      federal government, both civilian and military.[7] American Indians of the
      Paiute, Shoshone, and Washoe tribes inhabit what is now Nevada. The first
      Europeans to explore the region were Spanish. They called the region
      Nevada (snowy) because of the snow which covered the mountains in winter,
      similar to the Sierra Nevada in Spain. The area formed part of Alta
      California's territory within the Viceroyalty of New Spain, which gained
      independence as Mexico in 1821. The United States annexed the area in 1848
      after its victory in the Mexican–American War, and it was incorporated as
      part of Utah Territory in 1850. The discovery of silver at the Comstock
      Lode in 1859 led to a population boom that became an impetus to the
      creation of Nevada Territory out of western Utah Territory in 1861. Nevada
      became the 36th state on October 31, 1864, as the second of two states
      added to the Union during the Civil War (the first being West
      Virginia).[8]
