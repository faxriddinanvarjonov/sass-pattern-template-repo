        >Louisiana[pronunciation 1] (French: La Louisiane [la lwizjan] (listen);
        Spanish: La Luisiana) is a state in the Deep South and South Central
        regions of the United States. It is the 20th-smallest by area and the
        25th most populous of the 50 U.S. states. Louisiana is bordered by the
        state of Texas to the west, Arkansas to the north, Mississippi to the
        east, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. A large part of its eastern
        boundary is demarcated by the Mississippi River. Louisiana is the only
        U.S. state with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are
        equivalent to counties, making it one of only two U.S. states not
        subdivided into counties (the other being Alaska and its boroughs). The
        state's capital is Baton Rouge, and its largest city is New Orleans,
        with a population of roughly 383,000 people.[7] Some Louisiana urban
        environments have a multicultural, multilingual heritage, being so
        strongly influenced by a mixture of 18th century Louisiana French
        (Cajun, Creole), Spanish, French Canadian, Acadian, Dominican Creole,
        Native American, and West African cultures that they are considered to
        be exceptional in the U.S. Before the American purchase of the territory
        in 1803, the present–day U.S. state of Louisiana had been both a French
        colony and a Spanish one. In addition, colonists imported various West
        African peoples as slaves in the 18th century. Many came from peoples of
        the same region of West Africa, thus concentrating their culture;
        Filipinos also arrived during colonial Louisiana. In the post–Civil War
        environment, Anglo Americans increased the pressure for Anglicization,
        and in 1921, English was for a time made the sole language of
        instruction in Louisiana schools before a policy of multilingualism was
        revived in 1974.[8][9] There has never been an official language in
        Louisiana, and the state constitution enumerates "the right of the
        people to preserve, foster, and promote their respective historic,
        linguistic, and cultural origins."[8] Based on national averages,
        Louisiana frequently ranks low among the U.S. in terms of health,[10]
        education,[11][12][13][14] development, and high in measures of
        poverty.[15][16][17] In 2018, Louisiana was ranked as the least healthy
        state in the country, with high levels of drug-related deaths. It also
        has had the highest homicide rate in the United States since at least
        the 1990s.[18][19][20] Much of the state's lands were formed from
        sediment washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and
        vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp.[21] These contain a rich southern
        biota; typical examples include birds such as ibises and egrets. There
        are also many species of tree frogs such as the state recognized
        American green tree frog and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish. In
        more elevated areas, fire is a natural process in the landscape and has
        produced extensive areas of tallgrass prairie, longleaf pine forest and
        wet savannas. These support an exceptionally large number of plant
        species, including many species of terrestrial orchids and carnivorous
        plants. Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other
        southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that
        are state recognized, and four that have not received
        recognition.[22]</i
