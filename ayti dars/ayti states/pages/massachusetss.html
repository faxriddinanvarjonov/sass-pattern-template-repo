        >Massachusetts (/ˌmæsəˈtʃuːsɪts/ (listen) MASS-ə-CHOO-sits, /-zɪts/
        -⁠zits; Massachusett: Muhsachuweesut [məhswatʃəwiːsət]), officially the
        Commonwealth of Massachusetts,[b] is a state in the New England region
        of the Northeastern United States. It borders the Atlantic Ocean and
        Gulf of Maine to its east, Connecticut and Rhode Island to its south,
        New Hampshire and Vermont to its north, and New York to its west.
        Massachusetts is the sixth smallest state by land area, but with over 7
        million residents,[note 1] it is the most populous state in New England,
        the 15th most populous in the country, and the third most densely
        populated, after New Jersey and Rhode Island. The state's capital and
        most populous city, as well as its cultural and financial center, is
        Boston. Massachusetts is also home to the urban core of Greater Boston,
        the largest metropolitan area in New England and a region profoundly
        influential upon American history, academia, and the research
        economy.[44] Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing, and
        trade,[45] Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center
        during the Industrial Revolution.[46] During the 20th century, the
        state's economy shifted from manufacturing to services,[47] and in the
        21st century it is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher
        education, finance, and maritime trade.[48] Massachusetts was a site of
        early English colonization: the Plymouth Colony was founded in 1620 by
        the Pilgrims of the Mayflower, and in 1630 the Massachusetts Bay Colony,
        taking its name from the indigenous Massachusett people, established
        settlements in Boston and Salem. In 1692, the town of Salem and
        surrounding areas experienced one of America's most infamous cases of
        mass hysteria, the Salem witch trials.[49] In 1777, General Henry Knox
        founded the Springfield Armory, which, during the Industrial Revolution,
        catalyzed numerous important technological advances, including
        interchangeable parts.[50] In 1786, Shays' Rebellion, a populist revolt
        led by disaffected American Revolutionary War veterans, influenced the
        United States Constitutional Convention.[51] In the 18th century, the
        Protestant First Great Awakening, which swept Britain and the Thirteen
        Colonies, originated from the pulpit of Northampton preacher Jonathan
        Edwards.[52] In the late 18th century, Boston became known as the
        "Cradle of Liberty"[53] for the agitation there that later led to the
        American Revolution.</i
