        >Iowa, constituent state of the United States of America. It was
        admitted to the union as the 29th state on December 28, 1846. As a
        Midwestern state, Iowa forms a bridge between the forests of the east
        and the grasslands of the high prairie plains to the west. Its gently
        rolling landscape rises slowly as it extends westward from the
        Mississippi River, which forms its entire eastern border. The Missouri
        River and its tributary, the Big Sioux, form the western border, making
        Iowa the only U.S. state that has two parallel rivers defining its
        borders. Iowa is bounded by the states of Minnesota to the north,
        Wisconsin and Illinois to the east, Missouri to the south, and Nebraska
        and South Dakota to the west. Des Moines, in the south-central part of
        the state, is the capital. The state name is derived from the Iowa
        Native American people who once inhabited the area.</i
