      Uzbekistan (UK: /ʊzˌbɛkɪˈstɑːn, ʌz-, -ˈstæn/, US: /ʊzˈbɛkɪstæn, Uzbek:
      Oʻzbekiston, Ўзбекистон, pronounced [ozbekiˈstɒn]; Russian: Узбекистан),
      officially the Republic of Uzbekistan (Uzbek: Oʻzbekiston Respublikasi,
      Ўзбекистон Республикаси), is a double-landlocked country located in
      Central Asia. It is surrounded by 5 landlocked countries: Kazakhstan to
      the north; Kyrgyzstan to the northeast; Tajikistan to the southeast;
      Afghanistan to the south; and Turkmenistan to the southwest. Its capital
      is Tashkent. Uzbekistan is a member of the Organization of Turkic States.
      The Uzbek language is the majority-spoken language in Uzbekistan, while
      Russian is spoken and understood throughout the country. Tajik is spoken
      as a minority language, predominantly in Samarkand and Bukhara. Islam is
      the predominant religion, most Uzbeks being Sunni Muslims. The first
      recorded settlers in what later is Uzbekistan were Eastern Iranian nomads,
      known as Scythians, who founded kingdoms in Khwarazm, Bactria, and Sogdia
      in the 8th–6th centuries BC, and Fergana and Margiana in the 3rd century
      BC – 6th century AD. The area was incorporated into the Iranian Achaemenid
      Empire and, after a period of Macedonian rule, was ruled by the Iranian
      Parthian Empire and later by the Sasanian Empire, until the Muslim
      conquest of Persia in the seventh century. The early Muslim conquests and
      the subsequent Samanid Empire converted most of the people, including the
      local ruling classes, into adherents of Islam. During this period, cities
      such as Samarkand, Khiva, and Bukhara began to grow from the Silk Road,
      and became a center of the Islamic Golden Age. The local Khwarazmian
      dynasty was destroyed by the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, leading
      to a dominance by Turkic peoples. Timurid Empire's capital Samarkand
      became a centre of science under the rule of Ulugh Beg, giving birth to
      the Timurid Renaissance. The territories of the Timurid dynasty were
      conquered by Shaybanids in the 16th century, moving the centre of power to
      Bukhara. The region was split into 3 states: the Khanate of Khiva, Khanate
      of Kokand, and Emirate of Bukhara. All of Central Asia was gradually
      incorporated into the Russian Empire during the 19th century, with
      Tashkent becoming the political center of Russian Turkestan. In 1924,
      national delimitation created the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic as a
      republic of the Soviet Union. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union,
      it declared independence as the Republic of Uzbekistan on 31 August 1991.
      Uzbekistan is a secular state, with a presidential constitutional
      government in place. It comprises 12 regions , Tashkent City, and 1
      autonomous republic, Karakalpakstan. While non-governmental human rights
      organisations have defined Uzbekistan as "an authoritarian state with
      limited civil rights", reforms under second president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev,
      have been made following the death of the first president, Islam Karimov.
      Owing to these reforms, relations with the neighbouring countries of
      Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan have improved. A United Nations
      report of 2020 found progress toward achieving UN's Sustainable
      Development Goals. The economy is in a gradual transition to the market
      economy, with foreign trade policy being based on import substitution. In
      September 2017, the currency became fully convertible at market rates.
      Uzbekistan is a producer and exporter of cotton. With power-generation
      facilities from the Soviet era and a supply of natural gas, Uzbekistan has
      become the largest electricity producer in Central Asia. From 2018 to
      2021, the republic received a BB- sovereign credit rating by both Standard
      and Poor and Fitch Ratings. The Brookings Institution described Uzbekistan
      as having large liquid assets, high economic growth, low public debt, and
      a low GDP per capita. Uzbekistan is a member of the Commonwealth of
      Independent States , United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation
      Organisation .
